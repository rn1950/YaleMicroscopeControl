2020-12-07: Operational version of da  vinci miniMaker
* basic communication is working
* to install, the only key needed is to make the USB device "ttyACM0" executable by non-root
    1. To check permissions
    `ls -lth /dev/ttyACM0`
    Should read: crw-rw---- 1 root alistair 166
    2. To edit permissions (if our user account isn't listed, which it won't be on a new machine):
    create the file xyzprinterrules in the following location and edit it to read the following text:
    `/etc/udev/rules.d/xyzprinterrules`
    KERNEL=="ttyACM[0-9]*", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="11f1", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2513", MODE="0660", GROUP="alistair"
      note: GROUP is the username that trys to run it.  
    After creating this file, run `sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart` to update.
    Now Kilroy should be able to talk to the CNC
* some fixes still needed:
    - system physically re-initializes everytime it is booted, homing the stage to 0,0,0, which has the z-axis all the way down.
    - system doesn't re-initialize or home upon start up.
    - system also doesn't remember where it left off on startup, so if the software is booted up and restarted, it leads to inconsistent physical behavior
