This software was originally developed in the Zhuang lab for the acquistion of STORM movies, and since diversified to other nanoscopy techniques including MERFISH, ORCA and general use microsocpy. Please see the Master branch at github.com/ZhuangLab/storm-control. Most of the code in this repository was written by the Zhuang lab or Boettiger lab.

This version was modified specifically to control a custom-built wide-field fluorescence microscope in the Bewersdorf lab and Murphy lab at Yale. There are some hard-coded modifications that would prevent this from working with other configurations.
